# coin_game
The player (you) and the computer both begin with a starting balance of $0.00. For each round of the game, both the player and the computer toss a quarter, a nickel, and a dime. For each type of coin, if the coin lands on heads, the amount of the coin is added to the player’s balance. If the coin lands on tails, however, nothing is added to the player’s balance for that coin.
